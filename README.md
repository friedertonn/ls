# ls

This is LS.COM for CP/M.

It is pretty much equivalent to the Linux "ls" command, i.e. an improvement on DIR that shows filenames, file sizes, and lets you order by name or size.

It is written in C and can be compiled using Aztec C v1.06D from Manx Software Systems:

cc ls.c
as ls
ln ls.o c.lib t.lib
